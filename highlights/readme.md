## [1. The Sense of ‘I Am’](/1-the-sense-of-i-am/)

**M:**&ensp;Even to say that you are not the body is not quite true. In a way you are all the bodies, hearts and minds, and much more. Go deep into the sense of ‘I am’ and you will find it. How do you find a thing that you have mislaid or forgotten? You keep it in your mind until you recall it. The sense of beïng, of ‘I am’, is the first to emerge. Ask yourself whence it comes or just watch it quietly. When the mind stays in the ‘I am’ without moving, you enter a state which cannot be verbalised, but can be experienced. All you need to do is to try and try again. After all, the sense ‘I am’ is always with you, only you have attached all kinds of things to it: body, feelings, thoughts, ideas, possessions etc. All of these self-identifications are misleading. Because of them, you take yourself to be what you are not.


## [2. Obsession with the Body](/2-obsession-with-the-body/)

**M:**&ensp;I see what you too could see, here and now, but for the wrong focus of your attention. You give no attention to your self. Your mind is all with things, people and ideas, never with your self. Bring your self into focus, become aware of your own existence. See how you function, watch the motives and the results of your actions. Study the prison you have inadvertantly built around yourself. By knowing what you are not, you come to know yourself. The way back to your self is through refusal and rejection. One thing is certain: the real is not imaginary; it is not a product of the mind. Even the sense ‘I am’ is not continuous, though it is a useful pointer, it shows where to seek but not what to seek. Just have a good look at it. Once you are convinced that you cannot say truthfully about your self anything except, “I Am” and that nothing that can be pointed at can be your self, the need for the ‘I am’ is over — you are no longer intent on verbalising what you are. All you need is to get rid of the tendency to define yourself. All definitions apply to your body only and to its expressions. Once this obsession with the body leaves, you will revert to your natural state spontaneously and effortlessly. The only difference between us is that I am aware of my natural state, while you are bemused. Just like gold made into ornaments has no advantage over gold dust except when the mind makes it so, so are we one in beïng — we differ only in appearance. We discover it by beïng earnest, by searching, enquiring, questioning daily and hourly, by giving one’s life to this discovery.


## [3. The Living Present](/3-the-living-present/)

**M:**&ensp;What is wrong with its seeking the pleasant and shirking the unpleasant? Between the banks of pain and pleasure the river of life flows. It is only when the mind refuses to flow with life and gets stuck at the banks that it becomes a problem. By flowing with life I mean acceptance — letting come what comes and go what goes. Desire not, fear not, observe the actual, as and when it happens, for you are not what happens, you are to whom it happens. Ultimately even the observer you are not. You are the ultimate potentiality of which the all-embracing consciousness is the manifestation and expression.


## [4. Real World Is Beyond the Mind](/4-real-world-is-beyond-the-mind/)

**M:**&ensp;Like everything mental, the so-called law of causation contradicts itself. No thing in existence has a particular cause — the entire universe contributes to the existence of even the smallest thing; nothing could be as it is without the universe beïng what it is. When the source and ground of everything is the only cause of everything, to speak of causality as a universal law is wrong. The universe is not bound by its content because its potentialities are infinite; besides, it is a manifestation or expression of a principle fundamentally and totally free.

…

**M:**&ensp;[Desire is] one of the many [causal factors]. For everything there are innumerable causal factors. But the source of all that is, is the Infinite Possibility, the Supreme Reality, which is in you and which throws its power and light and love on every experience. But this source is not a cause and no cause is a source. Because of that, I say everything is uncaused. You may try to trace how a thing happens, but you cannot find out why a thing *is* as it is. A thing is as it is, because the universe is as it is.


## [7. The Mind](/7-the-mind/)

**Q:**&ensp;But do you see and hear as we do?

**M:**&ensp;Yes, I appear to hear and see and talk and act, but to me it just happens, as to you digestion or perspiration happens. The body–mind machine looks after it, but leaves me out of it. Just as you do not need to worry about growing hair, so I need not worry about words and actions. They just happen and leave me unconcerned, for in my world nothing ever goes wrong.


## [8. The Self Stands Beyond Mind](/8-the-self-stands-beyond-mind/)

**M:**&ensp;How can an unsteady mind make itself steady? Of course it cannot. It is the nature of the mind to roam about. All you can do is to shift the focus of consciousness beyond the mind.

**Q:**&ensp;How is it done?

**M:**&ensp;Refuse all thoughts except one: the thought ‘I am’. The mind will rebel in the beginning, but with patience and perseverance it will yield and keep quiet. Once you are quiet, things will begin to happen spontaneously and quite naturally, without any interference on your part.

**Q:**&ensp;Can I avoid this protracted battle with my mind?

**M:**&ensp;Yes, you can. Just live your life as it comes, but alertly, watchfully, allowing everything to happen as it happens, doing the natural things the natural way, suffering, rejoicing — as life brings. This also is a way.

…

**M:**&ensp;You can have for the asking all the peace you want.

**Q:**&ensp;I am asking.

**M:**&ensp;You must ask with an undivided heart and live an integrated life.

**Q:**&ensp;How?

**M:**&ensp;Detach yourself from all that makes your mind restless. Renounce all that disturbs its peace. If you want peace, deserve it.

**Q:**&ensp;Surely everybody deserves peace.

**M:**&ensp;Only those who don’t disturb it deserve it.

**Q:**&ensp;In what way do I disturb peace?

**M:**&ensp;By beïng a slave to your desires and fears.

**Q:**&ensp;Even when they are justified?

**M:**&ensp;Emotional reäctions, born of ignorance or inadvertence, are never justified. Seek a clear mind and a clean heart. All you need is to keep quietly alert, enquiring into the real nature of yourself. This is the only way to peace.


## [10. Witnessing](/10-witnessing/)

**M:**&ensp;You discover that there is nothing to discover. You are what you are and that is all.

**Q:**&ensp;I do not understand!

**M:**&ensp;It is your fixed idea that you must be something or other that blinds you.

**Q:**&ensp;How can I get rid of this idea?

**M:**&ensp;If you trust me, believe when I tell you that you are the pure awareness that illuminates consciousness and its infinite content. Realise this and live accordingly. If you do not believe me, then go within, inquiring “What am I?”, or, focus your mind on ‘I am’, which is pure and simple beïng.

# [14. Appearances and the Reality](/14-appearances-and-the-reality/)

**M:**&ensp;Of course, everything is interlinked. And therefore everything has numberless causes. The entire universe contributes to the least thing. A thing is as it is because the world is as it is. You see, you deal in gold ornaments and I — in gold. Between the different ornaments there is no causal relation. When you melt down an ornament to make another, there is no causal relation between the two. The common factor is the gold. But you cannot say gold is the cause. It cannot be called a cause, for it causes nothing by itself. It is reflected in the mind as ‘I am’, as the ornament’s particular name and shape. Yet all is only gold. In the same way reality makes everything possible and yet, nothing that makes a thing what it is, its name and form, comes from reality. 


## [62. In the Supreme, the Witness Appears](/62-in-the-supreme-the-witness-appears/)

**Q:**&ensp;How is it that here, my mind is engaged in high topics and finds dwelling on them easy and pleasant, but when I return home I find myself forgetting all l have learnt here, worrying and fretting, unable to remember my real nature even for a moment. What may be the cause?

**M:**&ensp;It is your childishness you are returning to. You are not fully grown up; there are levels left undeveloped because unattended. Just give full attention to what in you is crude and primitive, unreasonable and unkind, altogether childish, and you will ripen. It is the maturity of heart and mind that is essential. It comes effortlessly when the main obstacles — inattention and unawareness — are removed. In awareness you grow.

## [63. The Notion of Doërship Is Bondage](/63-the-notion-of-doership-is-bondage/)

**M:**&ensp;Contemplate life as infinite, undivided, ever present, ever active, until you realise yourself as one with it. It is not even very difficult, for you will only be returning to your own natural condition.

Once you realise that all comes from within, that the world in which you live has not been projected onto you, but by you, your fear comes to an end. Without this realisation you identify yourself with the externals, like the body, mind, society, nation, humanity, even God or the Absolute. But these are all escapes from fear. It is only when you fully accept your responsibility for the little world in which you live and watch the process of its creation, preservation and destruction that you may be free from your imaginary bondage.


## [64. Whatever Pleases You Keeps You Back](/64-whatever-pleases-you-keeps-you-back/)

**Q:**&ensp;How does one come to know the knower?

**M:**&ensp;I can only tell you what I know from my own experience. When I met my *guru*, he told me, “You are not what you take yourself to be. Find out what you are. Watch the sense ‘I am’, find your real self”. I obeyed him because I trusted him. I did as he told me. All my spare time I would spend looking at myself in silence. And what a difference it made, and how soon! It took me only three years to realise my true nature. My *guru* died soon after I met him, but it made no difference. I remembered what he told me and persevered. The fruit of it is here with me.

…

**M:**&ensp;The witness attitude is also faith — it is faith in oneself. You believe that you are not what you experience and you look at everything as if from a distance. There is no effort in witnessing. You understand that you are the witness only and the understanding acts. You need nothing more — just remember that you are the witness only. If in the state of witnessing you ask yourself, “Who am I?”, the answer comes at once, though it is wordless and silent. Cease to be the object and become the
subject of all that happens; once having turned within, you will find yourself beyond the subject. When you have found yourself, you will find that you are also beyond the object, that both the subject and the object exist in you, but you are neither.

…

**Q:**&ensp;How does one reach the Supreme State?

**M:**&ensp;By renouncing all lesser desires. As long as you are pleased with the lesser, you cannot have the highest. Whatever pleases you keeps you back. Until you realise the unsatisfactoriness of everything, its transiency and limitation, and collect your energies in one great longing, even the first step is not made. On the other hand, the integrity of the desire for the Supreme is by itself a call from the Supreme. Nothing, physical or mental, can give you freedom. You are free once you understand that your bondage is of your own making and you cease forging the chains that bind you.


## [65. A Quiet Mind Is All You Need](/65-a-quiet-mind-is-all-you-need/)

**Q:**&ensp;It is all very tempting, but how am I to proceed to realise my universal being?

**M:**&ensp;You have two ways: you can give your heart and mind to self-discovery, or you accept my words on trust and act accordingly. In other words, either you become totally self-concerned, or totally unself-concerned. It is the word ‘totally’ that is important. You must be extreme to reach the Supreme.


## [66. All Search for Happiness Is Misery](/66-all-search-for-happiness-is-misery/)

**M:**&ensp;…It is but a dimensionless point of consciousness, a conscious nothing; all you can say about yourself is, “I am”. You are pure beïng–awareness–bliss. To realise that is the end of all seeking. You come to it when you see all you think yourself to be as mere imagination and stand aloof in pure awareness of the transient as transient, imaginary as imaginary, unreal as unreal. It is not at all difficult, but detachment is needed. It is the clinging to the false that makes the true so difficult to see. Once you understand that the false needs time and what needs time is false, you are nearer the reality, which is timeless, ever in the *now*. Eternity in time is mere repetitiveness, like the movement of a clock. It flows from the past into the future endlessly, an empty perpetuïty. Reality is what makes the present so vital, so different from the past and future, which are merely mental. If you need time to achieve something, it must be false. The real is always with you; you need not wait to be what you *are*. Only you must not allow your mind to go out of yourself in search. When you want something, ask yourself, “Do I really need it?”. And if the answer is, “No”, then just drop it.

…

**M:**&ensp;I have told you already that knowledge is most useful in dealing with things. But it does not tell you how to deal with people and yourself, how to live a life. We are not talking of driving a car or earning money. For this you need experience. But for beïng a light unto yourself, material knowledge will not help you. You need something much more intimate and deeper than material knowledge, to be your self in the true sense of the word. Your outer life is unimportant. You can become a night watchman and live happily. It is what you are inwardly that matters. Your inner peace and joy you have to earn. It is much more difficult than earning money. No university can teach you to be yourself. The only way to learn is by practice. Right away begin to be yourself. Discard all you are not and go ever deeper. Just as a man digging a well discards what is not water until he reaches the water-bearing strata, so must you discard what is not your own until nothing is left which you can disown. You will find that what is left is nothing which the mind can hook on to. You are not even a human beïng. You just *are* — a point of awareness, coëxtensive with time and space and beyond both, the ultimate cause, itself uncaused. If you ask me, “Who are you?”, my answer would be, “Nothing in particular. Yet, I am”.


## [67. Experience Is Not The Real Thing](/67-experience-is-not-the-real-thing/)

**M:**&ensp;Experience, however sublime, is not the real thing. By its very nature it comes and goes. Self-realisation is not an acquisition. It is more in the nature of understanding. Once arrived at, it cannot be lost. On the other hand, consciousness is changeful, flowing, undergoïng transformation from moment to moment. Do not hold on to consciousness and its contents. Consciousness held, ceases. To try to perpetuate a flash of insight or a burst of happiness is destructive to what it wants to preserve. What comes must go. The permanent is beyond all comings and goïngs. Go to the root of all experience, to the sense of beïng. Beyond beïng and not-beïng lies the immensity of the real. Try and try again.

…

**M:**&ensp;There is such a way, open to all, on every level, in every walk of life. Everybody is aware of himself. The deepening and broadening of self-awareness is the royal way. Call it mindfulness, or witnessing, or just attention — it is for all. None is unripe for it and none can fail. 

But, of course, you must not be merely alert. Your mindfulness must include the mind also. Witnessing is primarily awareness of consciousness and its movements.
