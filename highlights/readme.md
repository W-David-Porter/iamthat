## [7. The Mind](/7-the-mind/)

**Q:**&ensp;Is your world full of things and people as is mine?

**M:**&ensp;No, it is full of myself.

**Q:**&ensp;But do you see and hear as we do?

**M:**&ensp;Yes, I appear to hear and see and talk and act, but to me it just happens, as to you digestion or perspiration happens. The body–mind machine looks after it, but leaves me out of it. Just as you do not need to worry about growing hair, so I need not worry about words and actions. They just happen and leave me unconcerned, for in my world nothing ever goes wrong.


## [62. In the Supreme, the Witness Appears](/62-in-the-supreme-the-witness-appears/)

**Q:**&ensp;How is it that here, my mind is engaged in high topics and finds dwelling on them easy and pleasant, but when I return home I find myself forgetting all l have learnt here, worrying and fretting, unable to remember my real nature even for a moment. What may be the cause?

**M:**&ensp;It is your childishness you are returning to. You are not fully grown up; there are levels left undeveloped because unattended. Just give full attention to what in you is crude and primitive, unreasonable and unkind, altogether childish, and you will ripen. It is the maturity of heart and mind that is essential. It comes effortlessly when the main obstacles — inattention and unawareness — are removed. In awareness you grow.
