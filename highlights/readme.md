# Highlights


## [1. The Sense of ‘I Am’](/1-the-sense-of-i-am/)

&emsp;Even to say that you are not the body is not quite true. In a way you 
are all the bodies, hearts and minds, and much more. Go deep into the sense of 
‘I am’ and you will find it. How do you find a thing that you have mislaid or 
forgotten? You keep it in your mind until you recall it. The sense of being, 
of ‘I am’, is the first to emerge. Ask yourself whence it comes or just watch 
it quietly. When the mind stays in the ‘I am’ without moving, you enter a 
state which cannot be verbalised, but can be experienced. All you need to do 
is to try and try again. After all, the sense ‘I am’ is always with you, only 
you have attached all kinds of things to it: body, feelings, thoughts, ideas, 
possessions etc. All of these self-identifications are misleading. Because of 
them, you take yourself to be what you are not.


## [2. Obsession with the Body](/2-obsession-with-the-body/)

&emsp;I see what you too could see, here and now, but for the wrong focus of 
your attention. You give no attention to your self. Your mind is all with 
things, people and ideas, never with your self. Bring your self into focus, 
become aware of your own existence. See how you function, watch the motives 
and the results of your actions. Study the prison you have inadvertantly built 
around yourself. By knowing what you are not, you come to know yourself. The 
way back to your self is through refusal and rejection. One thing is certain: 
the real is not imaginary; it is not a product of the mind. Even the sense ‘I 
am’ is not continuous, though it is a useful pointer, it shows where to seek 
but not what to seek. Just have a good look at it. Once you are convinced that 
you cannot say truthfully about your self anything except, “I Am” and that 
nothing that can be pointed at can be your self, the need for the ‘I am’ is 
over — you are no longer intent on verbalising what you are. All you need is 
to get rid of the tendency to define yourself. All definitions apply to your 
body only and to its expressions. Once this obsession with the body leaves, 
you will revert to your natural state spontaneously and effortlessly. The only 
difference between us is that I am aware of my natural state, while you are 
bemused. Just like gold made into ornaments has no advantage over gold dust 
except when the mind makes it so, so are we one in being — we differ only in 
appearance. We discover it by being earnest, by searching, enquiring, 
questioning daily and hourly, by giving one’s life to this discovery.


## [3. The Living Present](/3-the-living-present/)

&emsp;What is wrong with its seeking the pleasant and shirking the unpleasant? 
Between the banks of pain and pleasure the river of life flows. It is only 
when the mind refuses to flow with life and gets stuck at the banks that it 
becomes a problem. By flowing with life I mean acceptance — letting come what 
comes and go what goes. Desire not, fear not, observe the actual, as and when 
it happens, for you are not what happens, you are to whom it happens. 
Ultimately even the observer you are not. You are the ultimate potentiality of 
which the all-embracing consciousness is the manifestation and expression.


## [4. Real World Is Beyond the Mind](/4-real-world-is-beyond-the-mind/)

&emsp;Like everything mental, the so-called law of causation contradicts itself. No thing in existence has a particular cause — the entire universe contributes to the existence of even the smallest thing; nothing could be as it is without the universe being what it is. When the source and ground of everything is the only cause of everything, to speak of causality as a universal law is wrong. The universe is not bound by its content because its potentialities are infinite; besides, it is a manifestation or expression of a principle fundamentally and totally free.

…

&emsp;[Desire is] one of the many [causal factors]. For everything there are innumerable causal factors. But the source of all that is, is the Infinite Possibility, the Supreme Reality, which is in you and which throws its power and light and love on every experience. But this source is not a cause and no cause is a source. Because of that, I say everything is uncaused. You may try to trace how a thing happens, but you cannot find out why a thing *is* as it is. A thing is as it is, because the universe is as it is.


## [7. The Mind](/7-the-mind/)

**Q:**&ensp;But do you see and hear as we do?

**M:**&ensp;Yes, I appear to hear and see and talk and act, but to me it just happens, as to you digestion or perspiration happens. The body–mind machine looks after it, but leaves me out of it. Just as you do not need to worry about growing hair, so I need not worry about words and actions. They just happen and leave me unconcerned, for in my world nothing ever goes wrong.


## [8. The Self Stands Beyond Mind](/8-the-self-stands-beyond-mind/)

**M:**&ensp;How can an unsteady mind make itself steady? Of course it cannot. It is the nature of the mind to roam about. All you can do is to shift the focus of consciousness beyond the mind.

**Q:**&ensp;How is it done?

**M:**&ensp;Refuse all thoughts except one: the thought ‘I am’. The mind will rebel in the beginning, but with patience and perseverance it will yield and keep quiet. Once you are quiet, things will begin to happen spontaneously and quite naturally, without any interference on your part.

**Q:**&ensp;Can I avoid this protracted battle with my mind?

**M:**&ensp;Yes, you can. Just live your life as it comes, but alertly, watchfully, allowing everything to happen as it happens, doing the natural things the natural way, suffering, rejoicing — as life brings. This also is a way.

…

**M:**&ensp;You can have for the asking all the peace you want.

**Q:**&ensp;I am asking.

**M:**&ensp;You must ask with an undivided heart and live an integrated life.

**Q:**&ensp;How?

**M:**&ensp;Detach yourself from all that makes your mind restless. Renounce all that disturbs its peace. If you want peace, deserve it.

**Q:**&ensp;Surely everybody deserves peace.

**M:**&ensp;Only those who don’t disturb it deserve it.

**Q:**&ensp;In what way do I disturb peace?

**M:**&ensp;By being a slave to your desires and fears.

**Q:**&ensp;Even when they are justified?

**M:**&ensp;Emotional reäctions, born of ignorance or inadvertence, are never justified. Seek a clear mind and a clean heart. All you need is to keep quietly alert, enquiring into the real nature of yourself. This is the only way to peace.


## [10. Witnessing](/10-witnessing/)

**M:**&ensp;You discover that there is nothing to discover. You are what you are and that is all.

**Q:**&ensp;I do not understand!

**M:**&ensp;It is your fixed idea that you must be something or other that blinds you.

**Q:**&ensp;How can I get rid of this idea?

**M:**&ensp;If you trust me, believe when I tell you that you are the pure awareness that illuminates consciousness and its infinite content. Realise this and live accordingly. If you do not believe me, then go within, enquiring “What am I?”, or, focus your mind on ‘I am’, which is pure and simple being.

# [14. Appearances and the Reality](/14-appearances-and-the-reality/)

&emsp;Of course, everything is interlinked. And therefore everything has numberless causes. The entire universe contributes to the least thing. A thing is as it is because the world is as it is. You see, you deal in gold ornaments and I — in gold. Between the different ornaments there is no causal relation. When you melt down an ornament to make another, there is no causal relation between the two. The common factor is the gold. But you cannot say gold is the cause. It cannot be called a cause, for it causes nothing by itself. It is reflected in the mind as ‘I am’, as the ornament’s particular name and shape. Yet all is only gold. In the same way reality makes everything possible and yet, nothing that makes a thing what it is, its name and form, comes from reality. 


## [18. To Know What You Are, Find What You Are Not](/18-to-know-what-you-are-find-out-what-you-are-not/)

&emsp;All I know is that whatever depends is not real. The real is truly independent. Since the existence of the person depends on the existence of the world and it is circumscribed and defined by the world, it cannot be real.


## [20. The Supreme is Beyond All](/20-the-supreme-is-beyond-all/)

&emsp;The source of consciousness cannot be an object in consciousness. To know the source is to *be* the source. When you realise that you are not the person, but the pure and calm witness, and that fearless awareness is your very being, you *are* the being. It is the source, the Inexhaustible Possibility.


## [26. Personality, an Obstacle](/26-personality-an-obstacle/)

&emsp;Go home, take charge of your father’s business, look after your parents in their old age. Marry the girl who is waiting for you, be loyal, be simple and be humble. Hide your virtue, live silently. The five senses and the three qualities (<span data-tippy-content="Attributes, qualities. In <em>Samkhya</em> philosophy the three attributes of the cosmic substance (<em>prakriti</em>) are: illuminating (<em>sattva</em>), activating (<em>rajas</em>) and restraining (<em>tamas</em>).">gunas</span>) are your eight steps in *yoga*. And ‘I am’ is the Great Reminder (<span data-tippy-content="The great incantation (see <em>mantra</em>).">mahamantra</span>). You can learn from them all you need to know. Be attentive, enquire ceaselessly. That is all.


## [29. Living is Life’s Only Purpose](/29-living-is-lifes-only-purpose/)

&emsp;Yet, all this is so in the mind only. As I see it, there is really nothing of 
the kind. In the great mirror of consciousness images arise and disappear and 
only memory gives them continuity. And memory is material — destructible, 
perishable and transient. On such flimsy foundations we build a sense of 
personal existence — vague, intermittent, dreamlike. This vague persuasion, ‘I 
am so-and-so’ obscures the changeless state of pure awareness and makes us 
believe that we are born to suffer and to die.

…

&emsp;Wherever it [the practice of dismissing everything as a dream] leads you, it 
will be a dream. The very idea of going beyond the dream is illusory. Why go 
anywhere? Just realise that you are dreaming a dream you call the world, and 
stop looking for ways out. The dream is not your problem. Your problem is that 
you like one part of your dream and not another. Love all or none of it, and 
stop complaining. When you have seen the dream as a dream, you have done all 
that needs be done.


## [30. You are Free NOW](/30-you-are-free-now/)

**Q:**&ensp;But what *can* I do here and now?

**M:**&ensp;You can be aware of your being — here and now.

**Q:**&ensp;That is all?

**M:**&ensp;That is all. There is nothing more to it.


## [31. Do Not Undervalue Attention](/31-do-not-undervalue-attention/)

&emsp;My actual experience is not different [from others’ experience]. It is 
my evaluation and attitude that differ. I see the same world as you do, but not 
the same way. There is nothing mysterious about it. Everybody sees the world 
through the idea he has of himself. As you think yourself to be, so you think 
the world to be. If you imagine yourself as separate from the world, the world 
will appear as separate from you and you will experience desire and fear. I do 
not see the world as separate from me and so there is nothing for me to desire 
or fear.

…

&emsp;At the root of all creation lies desire. Desire and imagination 
foster and reïnforce each other. The fourth state (<span 
data-tippy-content="The superconscious state of <em>samadhi</em>, 
(<em>turiya</em>, fourth), the fourth state of soul in which it becomes one 
with Brahman, the highest awareness.">turiya</span>) is a state of pure 
witnessing, detached awareness — passionless and wordless. It is like space, 
unaffected by whatever it contains. Bodily and mental troubles do not reach it 
— they are outside, ‘there’, while the witness is always ‘here’.

…

&emsp;Go on pondering, wondering, being anxious to find a way. Be conscious of 
yourself, watch your mind, give it your full attention. Don’t look for quick 
results; there may be none within your noticing. Unknown to you, your psyche 
will undergo a change: there will be more clarity in your thinking, charity in 
your feeling and purity in your behaviour. You need not aim at these — you 
will witness the change all the same. For, what you are now is the result of 
inattention and what you become will be the fruit of attention.


## [33. To See the Unreal Is Wisdom](/33-to-see-the-unreal-is-wisdom/)

&emsp;When effort is needed, effort will appear. When effortlessness 
becomes essential, it will assert itself. You need not push life about. Just 
flow with it and give yourself completely to the task of the present moment, 
which is the dying now to the now. For living is dying. Without death life 
cannot be. 

&emsp;Get hold of the main thing: that the world and the self are one and perfect. 
Only your attitude is faulty and needs reädjustment. This process or 
reädjustment is what you call *sadhana*. You come to it by putting an end to 
indolence and using all your energy to clear the way for clarity and charity. 
But in reality, these all are signs of inevitable growth. Don’t be afraid, 
don’t resist, don’t delay. Be what you are. There is nothing to be afraid of. 
Trust and try. Experiment honestly. Give your real being a chance to shape 
your life. You will not regret it.


## [36. Killing Hurts the Killer, Not the Killed](/36-killing-hurts-the-killer-not-the-killed/)

&emsp;The difficulty lies in our differing points of view. You speak from the body–mind’s. Mine is of the witness. The difference is basic.


## [38. Spiritual Practice Is Will Asserted and Reässerted](/38-spiritual-practice-is-will-asserted-and-reasserted/)

&emsp;The common things of life — I experience them just as you do. The difference lies in what I do not experience. I do not experience fear or greed, hate or anger. I ask nothing, refuse nothing, keep nothing. In these matters I do not compromise. Maybe this is the outstanding difference between us: I will not compromise and am true to myself, while you are afraid of reality.


## [42. Reality Cannot be Expressed](/42-reality-cannot-be-expressed/)

&emsp;You can do nothing to bring it about, but you can avoid creating obstacles. 
Watch your mind, how it comes into being, how it operates. 
As you watch your mind, you discover your self as the watcher. 
When you stand motionless, only watching, you discover your self as the light behind the watcher. 
The source of light is dark, unknown is the source of knowledge. 
That source alone is. 
Go back to that source and abide there. 
It is not in the sky nor in the all-pervading ether. 
God is all that is great and wonderful; I am nothing, have nothing, can do nothing. 
Yet all comes out of me — the source is me; the root, the origin, is me. 


## [44. ‘I Am’ Is True, All Else Is Inference](/44-i-am-is-true-all-else-is-inference/)

**Q:**&ensp;Still the main point seems to escape me. 
I can admit that the world in which I live and move and have my being is of my own creation, a projection of myself, of my imagination, on the unknown world, the world as it is, the world of ‘absolute matter’, whatever this matter may be. 
The world of my own creation may be quite unlike the ultimate, the real world, just like the cinema screen is quite unlike the pictures projected onto it. 
Nevertheless, this absolute world exists, quite independent of myself.

**M:**&ensp;Quite so — the world of Absolute Reality, onto which your mind has projected a world of relative unreality, is independent of yourself, for the very simple reason that it *is* yourself. 

**Q:**&ensp;Is there no contradiction in terms? 
How can independence prove identity?

**M:**&ensp;Examine the motion of change and you will see. 
What can change while you do not change can be said to be independent of you. 
But what is changeless must be one with whatever else is changeless. 
For duality implies interaction and interaction means change. 
In other words, the absolutely material and the absolutely spiritual, the totally objective and the totally subjective are identical both in substance and essence.


## [51. Be Indifferent to Pain and Pleasure](/51-be-indifferent-to-pain-and-pleasure/)

&emsp;I am now seventy-four years old. And yet I feel that I am an infant. I 
feel clearly that, in spite of all the changes, I am a child. My *guru* told 
me, “That child, which is you even now, is your real self” (<span 
data-tippy-content="One’s own form, nature, character.">svarupa</span>)”. Go 
back to that state of pure being where the ‘I am’ is still in its purity, 
before it became contaminated with ‘this I am’ or ‘that I am’. Your burden is 
of false self-identifications — abandon them all. My *guru* told me, “Trust 
me. I tell you: You are divine. Take it as the absolute truth. Your joy is 
divine, your suffering is divine, too. All comes from God. Remember it always. 
You are God; your will alone is done”. I did believe him and soon realised how 
wonderfully true and accurate his words were. I did not condition my mind by 
thinking, “I am God”, “I am wonderful”, “I am beyond”. I simply followed his 
instruction, which was to focus the mind on pure being, ‘I am’, and stay in 
it. I used to sit for hours together with nothing but the ‘I am’ in my mind, 
and soon peace and joy and a deep all-embracing love became my normal state. 
In it all disappeared: myself, my *guru*, the life I lived, the world around 
me. Only peace and unfathomable silence remained.

…

Do not struggle with your memories and thoughts; try only to include in your 
field of attention the other, more important questions like: “Who am I?”, “How 
did I happen to be born?”, “Whence this universe around me?”, “What is real 
and what is momentary?”. No memory will persist if you lose interest in it; it 
is the emotional link that perpetuates the bondage. You are always seeking 
pleasure, avoiding pain; always after happiness and peace. Don’t you see that 
it is your very search for happiness that makes you feel miserable? Try the 
other way: Be indifferent to pain and pleasure, neither asking nor refusing, 
give all your attention to the level on which ‘I am’ is timelessly present. 
Soon you will realise that peace and happiness are in your very nature and it 
is only seeking them through some particular channels that disturbs. Avoid the 
disturbance, that is all. To seek there is no need — you would not seek what 
you already have. You yourself are God, the Supreme Reality. To begin with, 
trust me, trust the Teacher. It enables you to make the first step — and then 
your trust is justified by your own experience. In every walk of life, initial 
trust is essential; without it little can be done. Every undertakeing is an act 
of faith. Even your daily bread you eat on trust! By remembering what I told 
you, you will achieve everything. I am telling you again: You are the 
all-pervading, all transcending reality. Behave accordingly: Think, feel and 
act in harmony with the whole and the actual experience of what I say will 
dawn upon you in no time. No effort is needed. Have faith and act on it. 
Please see that I want nothing from you. It is in your own interest that I 
speak because, above all, you love yourself and you want yourself to be 
secure and happy. Don’t be ashamed of it; don’t deny it. It is natural and 
good to love oneself. Only you should know what exactly it is that you love. 
It is not the body that you love, it is Life: perceiving, feeling, thinking, 
doing, loving, striving, creating. It is that Life you love, which is you, 
which is all. Realise it in its totality, beyond all divisions and 
limitations, and all your desires will merge in it, for the greater contains 
the smaller. Therefore find yourself, for in finding that you find all. 

Everybody is glad to be. But few know the fullness of it. You come to know by 
dwelling in your mind on ‘I am’, ‘I know’, ‘I love’ — with the will of 
reaching the deepest meaning of these words.


## [53. Desires Fulfilled Breed More Desires](/53-desires-fulfilled-breed-more-desires/)

&emsp;Let it kick. Just look at the kicking. And if you are too afraid of 
society to kick convincingly, look at that too. I know it is a painful 
business. But there is no remedy — except one: the search for remedies must 
cease. 

&emsp;If you are angry or in pain, separate yourself from anger and pain and 
watch them. Externalisation is the first step to liberation. Step away and 
look. The physical events will go on happening, but by themselves they have no 
importance. It is the mind alone that matters. Whatever happens, you cannot 
kick and scream in an airline office or in a bank. Society does not allow it. 
If you do not like their ways or are not prepared to endure them, don’t fly or 
carry money. Walk, and if you cannot walk, don’t travel. If you deal with 
society, you must accept its ways, for its ways are your ways. Your needs and 
demands have created them. Your desires are so complex and contradictory — no 
wonder the society you create is also complex and contradictory.

…

**M:**&ensp;Nature is neither pleasant nor painful. It is all intelligence and 
beauty. Pain and pleasure are in the mind. Change your scale of values and all 
will change. Pleasure and pain are mere disturbances of the senses; treat them 
equally and there will be only bliss. And the world is what you make it; by 
all means make it happy. Only contentment can make you happy — desires 
fulfilled breed more desires. Keeping away from all desires and contentment in 
what comes by itself is a very fruitful state — a precondition to the state of 
fullness. Don’t distrust its apparent sterility and emptiness. Believe me — it 
is the satisfaction of desires that breeds misery. Freedom from desires is 
bliss.

**Q:**&ensp;There are things that we need.

**M:**&ensp;What you need will come to you if you do not ask for what you do 
not need. Yet only few people reach this state of complete dispassion and 
detachment. It is a very high state, the very threshold of liberation.


## [62. In the Supreme, the Witness Appears](/62-in-the-supreme-the-witness-appears/)

**Q:**&ensp;How is it that here, my mind is engaged in high topics and finds dwelling on them easy and pleasant, but when I return home I find myself forgetting all l have learnt here, worrying and fretting, unable to remember my real nature even for a moment. What may be the cause?

**M:**&ensp;It is your childishness you are returning to. You are not fully grown up; there are levels left undeveloped because unattended. Just give full attention to what in you is crude and primitive, unreasonable and unkind, altogether childish, and you will ripen. It is the maturity of heart and mind that is essential. It comes effortlessly when the main obstacles — inattention and unawareness — are removed. In awareness you grow.

## [63. The Notion of Doership Is Bondage](/63-the-notion-of-doership-is-bondage/)

&emsp;Contemplate life as infinite, undivided, ever present, ever active, until you realise yourself as one with it. It is not even very difficult, for you will only be returning to your own natural condition.

&emsp;Once you realise that all comes from within, that the world in which you live has not been projected onto you, but by you, your fear comes to an end. Without this realisation you identify yourself with the externals, like the body, mind, society, nation, humanity, even God or the Absolute. But these are all escapes from fear. It is only when you fully accept your responsibility for the little world in which you live and watch the process of its creation, preservation and destruction that you may be free from your imaginary bondage.


## [64. Whatever Pleases You Keeps You Back](/64-whatever-pleases-you-keeps-you-back/)

**Q:**&ensp;How does one come to know the knower?

**M:**&ensp;I can only tell you what I know from my own experience. When I met my *guru*, he told me, “You are not what you take yourself to be. Find out what you are. Watch the sense ‘I am’, find your real self”. I obeyed him because I trusted him. I did as he told me. All my spare time I would spend looking at myself in silence. And what a difference it made, and how soon! It took me only three years to realise my true nature. My *guru* died soon after I met him, but it made no difference. I remembered what he told me and persevered. The fruit of it is here with me.

…

&emsp;The witness attitude is also faith — it is faith in oneself. You believe that you are not what you experience and you look at everything as if from a distance. There is no effort in witnessing. You understand that you are the witness only and the understanding acts. You need nothing more — just remember that you are the witness only. If in the state of witnessing you ask yourself, “Who am I?”, the answer comes at once, though it is wordless and silent. Cease to be the object and become the
subject of all that happens; once having turned within, you will find yourself beyond the subject. When you have found yourself, you will find that you are also beyond the object, that both the subject and the object exist in you, but you are neither.

…

**Q:**&ensp;How does one reach the Supreme State?

**M:**&ensp;By renouncing all lesser desires. As long as you are pleased with the lesser, you cannot have the highest. Whatever pleases you keeps you back. Until you realise the unsatisfactoriness of everything, its transiency and limitation, and collect your energies in one great longing, even the first step is not made. On the other hand, the integrity of the desire for the Supreme is by itself a call from the Supreme. Nothing, physical or mental, can give you freedom. You are free once you understand that your bondage is of your own making and you cease forging the chains that bind you.


## [65. A Quiet Mind Is All You Need](/65-a-quiet-mind-is-all-you-need/)

**Q:**&ensp;It is all very tempting, but how am I to proceed to realise my universal being?

**M:**&ensp;You have two ways: you can give your heart and mind to self-discovery, or you accept my words on trust and act accordingly. In other words, either you become totally self-concerned, or totally unself-concerned. It is the word ‘totally’ that is important. You must be extreme to reach the Supreme.


## [66. All Search for Happiness Is Misery](/66-all-search-for-happiness-is-misery/)

&emsp;…It is but a dimensionless point of consciousness, a conscious nothing; all you can say about yourself is, “I am”. You are pure being–awareness–bliss. To realise that is the end of all seeking. You come to it when you see all you think yourself to be as mere imagination and stand aloof in pure awareness of the transient as transient, imaginary as imaginary, unreal as unreal. It is not at all difficult, but detachment is needed. It is the clinging to the false that makes the true so difficult to see. Once you understand that the false needs time and what needs time is false, you are nearer the reality, which is timeless, ever in the *now*. Eternity in time is mere repetitiveness, like the movement of a clock. It flows from the past into the future endlessly, an empty perpetuity. Reality is what makes the present so vital, so different from the past and future, which are merely mental. If you need time to achieve something, it must be false. The real is always with you; you need not wait to be what you *are*. Only you must not allow your mind to go out of yourself in search. When you want something, ask yourself, “Do I really need it?”. And if the answer is, “No”, then just drop it.

…

&emsp;I have told you already that knowledge is most useful in dealing with things. But it does not tell you how to deal with people and yourself, how to live a life. We are not talking of driving a car or earning money. For this you need experience. But for being a light unto yourself, material knowledge will not help you. You need something much more intimate and deeper than material knowledge, to be your self in the true sense of the word. Your outer life is unimportant. You can become a night watchman and live happily. It is what you are inwardly that matters. Your inner peace and joy you have to earn. It is much more difficult than earning money. No university can teach you to be yourself. The only way to learn is by practice. Right away begin to be yourself. Discard all you are not and go ever deeper. Just as a man digging a well discards what is not water until he reaches the water-bearing strata, so must you discard what is not your own until nothing is left which you can disown. You will find that what is left is nothing which the mind can hook on to. You are not even a human being. You just *are* — a point of awareness, coëxtensive with time and space and beyond both, the ultimate cause, itself uncaused. If you ask me, “Who are you?”, my answer would be, “Nothing in particular. Yet, I am”.


## [67. Experience Is Not The Real Thing](/67-experience-is-not-the-real-thing/)

&emsp;Experience, however sublime, is not the real thing. By its very nature it comes and goes. Self-realisation is not an acquisition. It is more in the nature of understanding. Once arrived at, it cannot be lost. On the other hand, consciousness is changeful, flowing, undergoing transformation from moment to moment. Do not hold on to consciousness and its contents. Consciousness held, ceases. To try to perpetuate a flash of insight or a burst of happiness is destructive to what it wants to preserve. What comes must go. The permanent is beyond all comings and goings. Go to the root of all experience, to the sense of being. Beyond being and not-being lies the immensity of the real. Try and try again.

…

&emsp;There is such a way, open to all, on every level, in every walk of life. Everybody is aware of himself. The deepening and broadening of self-awareness is the royal way. Call it mindfulness, or witnessing, or just attention — it is for all. None is unripe for it and none can fail. 

&emsp;But, of course, you must not be merely alert. Your mindfulness must include the mind also. Witnessing is primarily awareness of consciousness and its movements.


## [68. Seek the Source of Consciousness](/68-seek-the-source-of-consciousness/)

&emsp;It is you that need my body to talk to you. I am not my body, nor do I need it. I am the witness only. I have no shape of my own. 

You are so accustomed to think of yourselves as bodies having consciousness that you just cannot imagine consciousness as having bodies. Once you realise that bodily existence is but a state of mind, a movement in consciousness, that the ocean of consciousness is infinite and eternal, and that, when in touch with consciousness, you are the witness only, you will be able to withdraw beyond consciousness altogether.

&emsp;Merely hearing will not help you much. You must keep it in mind and ponder it and try to understand the state of mind which makes me say what I say. I speak from truth; stretch your hand and take it. You are not what you think yourself to be, I assure you. The image you have of yourself is made up from memories and is purely accidental.


## [71. In Self-Awareness You Learn About Yourself](/71-in-self-awareness-you-learn-about-yourself/)

&emsp;The person is merely the result of a misunderstanding. In reality, there is no such thing. Feelings, thoughts and actions race before the watcher in endless succession, leaving traces in the brain and creating an illusion of continuity. A reflection of the watcher in the mind creates the sense of ‘I’ and the person acquires an apparently independent existence. In reality there is no person — only the watcher identifying himself with the ‘I’ and the ‘mine’. The teacher tells the watcher, “You are not this — there is nothing of yours in this except the little point of ‘I am’, which is the bridge between the watcher and his dream. ‘I am this, I am that’ is dream, while pure ‘I am’ has the stamp of reality on it. You have tasted so many things — all came to naught. Only the sense ‘I am’ persisted unchanged. Stay with the changeless among the changeful, until you are able to go beyond”.


## [72. What is Pure, Unalloyed, Unattached Is Real](/72-what-is-pure-unalloyed-unattached-is-real/)

&emsp;Realise that you are not the master of what happens — you cannot control the future except in purely technical matters. Human relationship cannot be planned, they are too rich and varied. Just be understanding and compassionate, free of all self-seeking.

**Q:**&ensp;Does it [standing aloof] imply avoidance of action?

**M:**&ensp;You cannot avoid action. It happens like everything else.

**Q:**&ensp;My actions, surely, I can control.

**M:**&ensp;Try. You will soon see that you do what you must.

**Q:**&ensp;I can act according to my will.

**M:**&ensp;You know your will only after you have acted.

**Q:**&ensp;I remember my desires, the choices made, the decisions taken and act accordingly.

**M:**&ensp;Then your memory decides, not you.

**Q:**&ensp;Where do I come in?

**M:**&ensp;You make it possible by giving it attention.

&emsp;It is both — the last remnant of illusion, the first touch of the 
real. To say, “I am only the witness” is both false and true: false because of 
the ‘I am’, true because of the witness. It is better to say, “There is 
witnessing”. The moment you say, “I am”, the entire universe comes into being 
along with its creator.
