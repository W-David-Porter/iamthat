15. it is a very tiny little thing, a speck — the sense ‘I am’,

16. only the ‘I am’ endures.

22. The difficulty comes with the word ‘state’
22. The idea ‘I am the witness only’ will purify the body
22. the experience ‘I am the world, the world is mine’ is supremely valid

24. Go in the direction of ‘I am’.
